python inner working

python chai.py

code => Byte Code => python VM
           |
           Mostly hidden

1. compile to byte code
               | 
               low level & platform independent
-> byte code run faster
.pyc -> compiled python (frozen binaries)
 
==>  __pycache__

    source change & python version
     hello.cpython-312.pyc
    -> works only for imported files
    -> not for top level files

-> Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
    - code loop to iterate byte code
    - run time engine
    - also known as python interpreter

    Byte code is NOT machine code
    - python specific interpretation
    - cpython, jpython, IronPython, Stackless, PyPy
        |
        standard implementation


from importlib import reload => to reload the import statement if we add any thing after the binary files are generated
then: reload(filename)  // in python shell

ERRORS:
NameError: name '' is not defined => no vatiable name like "" in file
IndentationError
AttributeError
SyntaxError
TypeError: '' object does not support item assignment
KeyError  // in dictionary

==> Mutable and Immutable
Mutable => can be changed
Immutable => cannot be changed


memory refrence is either Mutable and Immutable
